    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>These muffins were designed for superheroes like you.</strong> They're packed full of veggies, and are sweetened with maple syrup instead of refined sugar. In addition, almond meal and whole grain oats replace nutrient-stripped white flour.</p>
    <p>And <strong>don't</strong> fear the butter. Fueling up with healthy fats is a great way to start your day. Fat helps transport important vitamins throughout your hardworking body and will help keep you satisfied <em>longer</em>.</p>

        <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (use gluten-free if sensitive)</li>

        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
