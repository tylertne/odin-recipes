    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>These muffins were designed for superheroes like you.</strong> They're packed full of veggies, and are sweetened with maple syrup instead of refined sugar. In addition, almond meal and whole grain oats replace nutrient-stripped white flour.</p>
    <p>And <strong>don't</strong> fear the butter. Fueling up with healthy fats is a great way to start your day. Fat helps transport important vitamins throughout your hardworking body and will help keep you satisfied <em>longer</em>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups almond meal (same thing as almond flour)</li>
        <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (use gluten-free if sensitive)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped raw sliced almonds (Flanagan calls for chopped walnuts)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup grated carrot (about 2 carrots)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Grade B maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>Paper muffin cups</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper muffin cups.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the almond meal, oats, nuts, raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, carrot, butter, maple syrup, and vanilla.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the muffin cups filling each to the brim. Bake until the muffins are nicely browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
